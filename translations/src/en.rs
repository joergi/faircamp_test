Millions of people browse the web using screen-readers \
because they can not see (or not well enough). Images \
without textual descriptions are inaccessible to them, \
and this is why we should make the effort to provide \
image descriptions for them.<br><br>\
\
Consult the faircamp README for how to add image \
descriptions, it's simple and an act of \
kindness.<br><br>\
\
Here are some tips for writing good image descriptions:<br>\
- Any description is better than having no description, don't worry about doing it wrong.<br>\
- Make it concise. Write as much as needed, but at the same time keep it as short as possible.<br>\
- Don't interpret. Describe what is there and relevant for its understanding, don't analyze beyond that.<br>\
- You can use colors where it makes sense - many people only lost their sight later on and understand and appreciate colors."),
