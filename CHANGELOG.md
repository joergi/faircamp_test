# Changelog

## 1.6

Released on August 30, 2025

### Introducing chinese translations

[Oliver Geer](https://oliver.geer.im) has put in a lot of effort to provide two first, complete
chinese translations of Faircamp, namely in Simplified/Mandarin/PRC Official Putonghua dialect (zh-hans-cn) and
Traditional/Mandarin/Taiwan dialect (zh-hant-tw).

Oliver is not a native speaker - "just" a very skilled and highly commited polyglot! -
so if you happen to be a native speaker and want to contribute on top of his efforts,
you are warmly invited to review and improve the translations on Faircamp's dedicated
[translation page](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/translate)!

- Add Chinese (Simplified, Mandarin, Mainland China) ([`ace0702`](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp/commit/ace070213f32e4232228a5986162c553ac7ca343))
- Add Chinese (Traditional, Mandarin, Taiwan) ([`20316d4`](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp/commit/20316d4b22d2d3e55d032e3e074d66187b260caf))
- Clarify meaning of geographical codes in Chinese language codes ([`ad40894`](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp/commit/ad40894f645ca4a0680e038a9254481278a62081))

### Important fix for embeds – Action Required (if you use them)

This release fixes a prominent padding issue with embeds, where (without manual css tweaks)
one could observe excessive padding above and especially below an embed.

Heads up though: As the main ingredient to fixing this lies in the embed
(iframe) code itself, you will need to first update the faircamp site, but
then also replace the already embedded code with the updated code that
faircamp now generates.

- Statically set embedded player height, shift background below timeline padding ([`114f2e2`](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp/commit/114f2e22ce5f568afdb2251684efc2a0af8cb1b9))

- Pass through and link external artist pages in client-side browser script ([`101899d`](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp/commit/101899dfe43e0b9bb30272ef07a3a48582cae7e4)) (with [徒settoセット](https://setto.basspistol.com/))

## 1.5

Released on July 30, 2025

### Support for anchor/id references in the link option

<video alt="A video showing how a generic link on a faircamp release page can now jump to an arbitrary section on the page, or even jump trigger playback of a specific track and timecode" autoplay controls loop muted playsinline src="https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/changes/1.5.0/links.mp4"></video>

The new anchor/id references in action

Before this release, the [link](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/manual/releases-release-eno.html#link) option only supported full urls like "https://example.com".
1.5 now supports "#some-id" style internal page references, either for linking to anchors that you manually place in your [more](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/manual/releases-release-eno.html#more)
section, or for using faircamp's [timecode/track linking](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/manual/linking-to-timecodes-tracks.html) directly from the link option.

![A screenshot of the markup in the release.eno manifest that sets up what was shown in the video earlier, with three sections pointed out specifically:  link: label = Lyrics url = #lyrics  link: label = Jump to 0:20 in track 3  url = #track=3&time=20s  <a id="lyrics"></a> ## Lyrics  This release has no lyrics at all, but just for the sake of demonstration ...  Roses are red Violets are blue A great lyricist Slumbers in you](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/changes/1.5.0/links.png)

The markup inside a release.eno manifest used for the demo above
